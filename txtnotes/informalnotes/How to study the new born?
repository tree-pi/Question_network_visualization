How to study the new born's development?
	_ what are the common barriers?
		_a_@JustinWood noisy measurements of new borns; hard to control the environment; lack the computational models.
	_ What is the advantage of using newborn chicks?
		_a_@JustinWood Their experience can be controlled directly; similar cortical circuits and similar cognitive capacities with human. [really? curiosity-driven learning for chicks?]
		_ What is the environment setting?
			_ What are the other sensory inputs -- are they controlled?
				_a_ No
			_ Do chicks interact with the environment?
				_a_ yes, not directly but their actions will cause the scene changes.
		_ What is the data you get from this exp setting?
			_a_ Automatic record of position, view points, action, etc.
		_ What are the results?
			_ What can the chicks do?
				_ What to probe?
					_a... 
					... imprinting: all chicks cluster together.
					... one-shot transfer learning.
					... object permanance.
						_ Can we manipulate the visual experiences to see if still the chicks show the object permanance?
							_a_ yes, if the chick only sees discrete movement not smooth movement.
					end_
	_ How to design AI to mimic these chicks?
		_a_ three components: visual processing (DNN), memory (experience replay), curiosity-driven learning.
			_ What behaviors to test on the AIs?
				_a...
				... imprinting behavior. (most likely driven by the curiosity-motivated learning)
				... attention to objects.
