What is the to be explained?
	_a_ modeling human sequence learning.
		_ What are the paradigms?
			_a...
			... Serial reaction time(SRT). "participants are asked to respond to a fixed set of stimuli and each cue signals a different button press need to be made. Unknow to participants the stimuli transition may follow some regularity. This regularity can be implicitly learned, indicated by decreased reaction time."
			... Statistical word learning.

What is the model?
	_specification...
	... How is the stimuli represented?
		_a_ A shift register memory encoding each step a vector with N entries(N=total possible event) and together forming a NxP matrix.
			_@me how is P decided?
	... How is response made?
		_a_ Each response corresponds to a detector with an activation level determined by a weighted sum with all records in the memory but an exponential decay rate to weight more on the more recent events. Activation converted to outcome ranged 0-1. Response follow a probability distribution based on the outcome.
			_@me What is the intuition behind this weighted sum calculation?
				_a_@me if a squared decay is used instead of exponential, any N-gram can be achieved. using a fixed decay rate for exponential also assumes some periodic regularity. because the detector matrix is so big, nearly any pattern can be learned.
	... What is the learning algorithm? 
		_a_ Delta rule update factor times the original factor and consider the transformation (activation->outcome). Learning rate and decay rate is fixed.
			_@me How could it possibly work that decay rate is fixed across all different tasks?
	end_

How well does the model describe the behavioral data?
	_ How well does it describe SRT?
		_a_ It could even replicate the Lee 1997 with a rule of "visit all elements in the set for every 6 elements", where participants show decreased RT in every 6 element period. 
			_ How is the model able to achieve this?
				_a_ Looking at the weight matrix of detectors, the repetition of same item is strongly prohibited.
	_ How well does it describe statistical word learning?
		_a_ Yes it can recognize regularties in words compared to random syllabus.
