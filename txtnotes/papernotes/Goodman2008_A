How do people learn concepts by inferring the rules of categorization?
	_ What is the problem setting?
		_a_ examples with features (binary or continuous numbers) and a label.
			_ What is the scale of problem?
				_specify...
				... How many features?
				... How many labels?
				end_
	_ What is the learning algorithm?
		_ How to represent the mapping from features to labels?
			_a_ Based on logic rules.
				_ How to generate rules (since there's infinite amount of possible rules)?
					_a_ context-free “disjunctive normal form”(DNF) grammar which is able to generate any logical expression (with conditions, conjunctions and disjunctions).
						_challenge_@me This grammar cannot express all possible logical boundaries? Are those weird classifications just unatural and never appear in real life?
		_ How to learn the mapping rules given examples?
			_a_ Using Bayesian inference.
				_ How to get probability distribution of rule formulae which are all discrete?
					_a_ Assigning probabilities for each production (same level productions normalized to 1).
						_ How to decide the exact values for production probability?
							_a_@me fit to human data to decide...
							_a_ Use a uniform distribution of this parameter, then marginalize out to get prior for formula.
				_ How to get the posterior given examples and a specific rule?
					_ How to deal with outliers?
						_a_ The more outliers given formula, the less likely, plus a prior probability of outliers (how to decide on that? free parameter?)
				_ How to select the best rule among all the rules?		


	_ How well does the model explain behavioral data?
		_ Does it explain human response in lab experiments?
		_ Does it explain naturalistic categorization data?

	_ Can this model be generalized to other problems?
		_a_@[P]Piantadosi2016_logical richer logical theories (Kemp et al. 2008a; Kemp, 2012), as well as conceptual domains like magne- tism (Ullman et al., 2012), semantic hierarchies (Katz, Goodman, Kersting, Kemp, & Tenenbaum, 2008), number concepts (Piantadosi, Tenenbaum, & Goodman, 2012), and function words (Piantadosi, Goodman, & Tenenbaum, 2014).
