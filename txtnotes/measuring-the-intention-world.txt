Questions that scientists actually ask:
- is the "latent space/manifold" real? Or is it purely theoretical?
My view: they are useful tools. Like "force/energt/fields"; But then you feel photons are "real things", more real than "electral-magnetic field" -- why? Because they have instinct properties?

What are the "-ism"s?
	_ What is naturalism?
		_ What is this author's version of naturalism?
			_a_ "normative judgments about the epistemic status of behavioral generalizations are given not by any favored philosophical principles but by the standards of sound estimation in the particular field"
			 	_@me what are the philo principles? aren't they just somewhat different version of the scientific practice? and what is the "standards of sound estimation" -- how are they different in different field?
	_ What is logical positivism?
		_a_@DavidBarack Theory-neutral beliefs that can be experienced => true knowledge.
	_ What is realism?
		_a_@DavidBarack Hard to distinguish theory v.s. observation, so we don't draw that hard line and ... what??
	_ What is measured realism?
		_a_ "Our background social and psychological theories need not be approximately true but only good enough to support weak cases of abduction".
			_@me What is abduction?
			_@me How is social science different from natural science then?

What is different from the "narrative" way of approaching human & society, versus the social science statistical way?
	_a_@me The importance of picturistic, specific example told in a coherent story is quite different. The logical coherence may be similarly important, or even more important in the story. But stories are hard to falsify, even harder to generalize (not to more cases collected by the theorist, but to any case), making that very different.To give a more clear image, analogy is always used to "pretend" as logic.

	_ Why is the narrative way still popular given that we have the scientific method?
		_a_@author We are too proud and wanna to be the only special being.
		_a_@me there is better cognitive appreciation for vivid images and simple clear stories; also just so many things that science are not touched upon fully yet.
